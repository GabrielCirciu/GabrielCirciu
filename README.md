Hi,

I'm a data scientist, with a passion for large scale data analysis, MLOps, data visualization, and networking solutions.
My last projects were:
- fraud detection in datasets that were presented as real / organic
- named entity recognition in latin using an unsupervised language model
- wind analytics to predict power generated with wind turbines across a large region
- machine vision model to estimate probabilities of aperson having skin cancer based on skin lesion pictures
- developing a plugin in minecraft that enhances the difficulty using an exhaustion system

All the best,
Gabriel
