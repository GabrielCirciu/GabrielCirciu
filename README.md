Hi,

I'm a Data Scientist with a passion for security, interactive design, and networking solutions. I am currently researching and developing a machine learning model that predicts keyboard presses using data from a brain-computer-interface.

My latest DS projects were:
- fraud detection in datasets that were presented as real / organic
- named entity recognition in latin using an unsupervised language model
- analytics to predict power generated with wind turbines across a large region
- machine vision model to estimate probabilities of a person having skin cancer based on skin lesion pictures

Alongside that I do some more fun things:
- created a backend databse management system for a distributed network
- developed a plugin in minecraft that increases the difficulty of the game using an exhaustion system

Cheers!
